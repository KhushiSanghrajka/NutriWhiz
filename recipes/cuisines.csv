","To begin making Cauliflower Paneer Kofta Curry Recipe place big pot on the heat. Add 1 liter of water into the pot and bring it to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the boiling water and turn off the heat.Next, to chop up the cauliflower, first remove the stem and leafy parts of the cauliflower and immerse it into the just-boiled, hot water. Allow the cauliflower sit for about 3 to 4 minutes. Then remove it from hot water, and place it on a kitchen towel. Pat it dry completely.Now grate the cauliflower completely and set it aside for a while. After about 10 minutes, cauliflower would have released a lot of water, squeeze it out and discard the water.Next, heat a pan and dry roast the grated cauliflower until it feels completely dry and contains no more moisture.

Cover the dough and allow it to rest until we prepare the filling for the parathas .To make the filling, combine all the ingredients for the filling in a large bowl. Check for the salt and spice levels in the filling and adjust to suit your taste.Now that we have both the dough and the filling ready, we will begin the process of making the stuffedï¿½ï¿½Broccoli Paratha.Divide the dough into 6-8 equal portions. Take one portion and dust in dry flour. Roll the dough to make a 3-4 inch diameter circle. Place 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center on the circle and bring the dough edges together towards the center. Seal the edges of the dough and pinch out any excess dough from the stuffed par.Flatten the paratha with your fingers, dust it in flour once again and roll the paratha applying very gentle pressure to make a 5 to 6 inch diameter circle.Proceed the same way with the remaining dough portions and stuff with the filling and roll into a paratha.Our next step is to cook the paratha; for this preheat a skillet (roti tawa) (preferably iron skillet).When the skillet is hot; place the stuffed rolled our paratha on the skillet and cook for a minute on both sides until you notice a few brown spots appear.When you notice the brown spots, smear some ghee or oil on both sides and cook until the paratha has turned golden brown and lightly crisp on both sides.

","In a wide bowl, add wheat flour, salt, oil, needed water and prepare a soft and smooth dough. Cover and keep it aside for 15-20 minutes. Dough should not be too hard.The next step is to prepare the stuffing. Pressure cook potatoes for 3 whistles or until soft. Peel the skin and mash them well.Heat oil in a non-stick pan. Add dry red chili and cumin seeds.Once it splutters, add hing/asafoetida, finely chopped onions, green chillies, ginger and pinch of salt and saute until onions turn transparent. Adding salt while cooking onions, prevents it from sticking and getting burnt.Then add the mashed potatoes, turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, kitchen king masala powder/ garam masala powder, chaat masala and salt and saute for 3-4 minutes till everything gets blended well.Be careful while adding salt at this stage, as we have added a pinch of salt to onions. Plus we are using chaat masala and cheese, so the stuffing will require less salt than usual. Check the salt level and add salt accordingly.Lastly, add 1/4 cup grated cheese and finely chopped coriander leaves, mix well and leave it to cool.Before starting to make parathas, knead the dough well. If needed, use 1/2 teaspoon oil and knead till it becomes smooth and soft.Divide the dough and stuffing into equal parts and make balls out of it. This will make 4 parathas.Dust a little flour and roll out the dough into a small circle.Keep stuffing in the center, gather all the corners and seal the dough with the stuffing inside. Press it down gently to flatten it.Dust a little four and roll it again very gently, so that stuffing doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t come out.Heat a tawa/non stick pan and place the paratha.Cook the paratha using little oil/butter/ghee till golden brown spots appears on both sides.

Ingredients for the sugar syrup

","To begin making the Jalebi Recipe, we will first begin the preparation by mixing the maida, corn flour, baking soda, ghee and turmeric powder in a medium bowl. ï¿½ï¿½Combine all the dry ingredients well, until well combined.Add yogurt to the dry ingredients and blend them all together to make a thick batter by adding very little water. The consistency of the batter should be thick and not watery, similar to the butter cream batter. You should be able to make a shape when piped in a piping bag.When done, cover the jalebi batter and place it in a warm place for 24 hours or overnight, till it is fermented (the batter will rise on fermentation). Once the batter is fermented stir the batter in a cut and fold motion to combine it once again.Dont over stir you want the air pockets in the batter to remain. This will help in the jalebi being crisp and also in turn help it absorb the sugar syrup.To make the sugar syrup, boil the sugar with water and saffron powder in a small bowl on medium heat until the sugar dissolvehen the sugar becomes thick and stringy of one string consistency.Turn off the heat and keep aside.Now to make the jalebis, preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is hot enough, you will know this, when you add a drop of batter in and it will come rising to the top almost immediately.Once you have filled the piping bag, pipe spirals of the batter onto the medium hot oil, until you get at least 3 concentric circles.ï¿½ï¿½Fry the jalebi on medium heat until golden brown in colour and crisp. Once the jalebi is crisp and browned, drain the excess oil out and immediately dip the jalebi into the hot sugar syrup.Piping the jalebis into the medium hot oil takes a little experience, the more you pipe the more practice you will get and the better you get at it.ï¿½ï¿½The Jalebis should rest in the sugar syrup for at least a minute, after which they can be drained out of the excess syrup and then served.Enjoy these crisp, sweet Homemade Jalebis as a wonderful dessert or a sweet option for your guests.Serve theï¿½ealebi Recipe as a Indian Party Dessertï¿½ï¿½for the festival of Holi or Diwali.Note:Ensure the batter is thick and firm, or else they wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t retain the shape of the jalebis.ï¿½ï¿½The oil for frying should be medium hot.

","To begin making the Balushahi (Badusha) recipe, we have to follow a two stage cooking process. First is to make the fried dough and second the sugar syrup.ï¿½ï¿½To make the dough In a large bowl add in the flour, the salt and a 1/4 teaspoon of soda.ï¿½ï¿½Stir to combine the dry ingredients . Next add in the ghee to the flour mixture.ï¿½ï¿½Using your fingers combine the flour and ghee to make coarse crumbs . Its takes a good one minute to get this texture. Once you get the coarse crumbs texture, add in the yogurt. knead just enough until all the ingredients come together.Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth and allow it to rest for about 30 minutesAfter 30 minutes of resting the dough we will divide the dough into equal portions of large lemon size, making a dent in the center with the thumb. Take care not to press too much while shaping them as this can cause cracks in them.Cover the dough portions with a wet cloth and allow them to rest for another 15 minutes.Next, preheat the oil for deep frying. Start aballs at a time into the oil and fry them on medium heat. The medium heat helps the balushahi to cook evenly from the inside.Once you notice that the dough balls come floating up to the surface flip over and fry until the bottom half is darker golden brown. Remember it is important to fry them on medium heat and not high heat so it gets evenly cooked from the inside.Once both sides are browned well, drain and continue the same with the remaining dough portions and keep them aside.Now let's get the ingredients needed for the sugar syrup.ï¿½ï¿½In a sauce pan add in 1/4 cup of water, 1 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cardamom powder. ï¿½ï¿½With heat on medium, stir the mixture well until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil.Once the mixture comes to a boil, add in the cardamom powder, turn the heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer until you get a single thread consistency.You will know that it has reached the single thread when you touch the sugar syrup between your fingers, you will find it And when the syrup drips from the spoon it will look a longer drop.We will now dip each of the fried doughs one at a time in the sugar syrup until it gets coated all around and arrange then on a platter. Continue the same with the remaining fried dough.Garnish the Balushahi (Badusha) with pistachios and allow them to rest until the sugar hardens.

","To begin making the Smoked Dhaba Dal Recipe; we will use the pressure cooker method to make the dal in one pot along with all the spices.Soak the tuvar dal and green moong dal for about an hour in water. Once you are through with the soaking time, get all the ingredients ready.Heat a teaspoon of oil in the pressure cooker; add the onions, ginger, garlic and green chillies and saute for a few minutes until the onions are lightly tender and softened. Add the tomatoes, and the remaining spices and saute until you smell the aromas coming through.Add the soaked dals, salt and add 3 cups of water. Cover the pressure cooker, place the weight on and cook until you hear 2 to 3 whistles. After two to three whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer the Dhaba Dal for about 5 to 8 minutes. Once done, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally.The dal continues to cook under the pressure, hence we allow it to rest until the pressure releases.Once the pressure releases; open the cooker and you will notice the dal cooked and mushy. That is how we want the Dhaba Dal to appear. Stir in the chopped coriander leaves and check the salt and spice levels. Adjust to suit your taste. Adjust the consistency of the dal, by adding water.Now the final step is to add the smoked flavor and to prepare the seasoning.To smoke the dal heat charcoal until red hot over the gas burner (direct flame). Once the coal is red hot, place it in a heatproof bowl.Place this bowl on top of the cooked lentils. Drizzle a teaspoon of ghee over the hot coal. The coal will begin to smoke almost instantly. At this stage, cover the dal pan and allow the smoke to circulate inside. This process of smoking a dal,ï¿½ï¿½is called Dhungar or Coal Smoking Technique.After about a minute, open the dal pan and you will see the smoke effect has withered. Transfer the Smoked Dhaba Dal to a serving bowl.For the seasoning; heat a teaspoon of ghee in a small pan; add the cumin seeds, the slivered garlic, and red chillies. Allow the cumin to crackle for a few secoand turn off the heat. Pour this seasoning over the Smoked Dhaba Dal.Serveï¿½ï¿½Smoked Dhaba Dal Recipe along withï¿½ï¿½Garlic Naanï¿½ï¿½andï¿½ï¿½Palak Raitaï¿½ï¿"

The heat needs to be on low from now on till the end of the making of Mysore Pak.Once the gram flour is combined well, add ghee little at a time and repeat the addition of ghee after 3-4 minutes of stirring. The 1-1/2 cups of ghee needs to be added in small batches with a space of 3 minutes between each turn.As you keep adding ghee and waiting for the next batch of ghee to be added, ensure that you keep stirring the Mysore Pak.Once the entire mass comes together and looks smooth, add the last portion of ghee and continue to stir till the whole masses rises up like froth and you will notice that the Mysore pak gets a very porous texture where you see the eye holes while stirring.Once it comes to this consistency, remove from the heat and pour the mysore pak mixture into the greased tray. Bang the tray lightly to allow the mass to spread all over and looks evenly spread.Dip a flat spatula with ghee and spread over the Mysore Pak to level it down and make it smooth from the top.ï¿½ï¿½Continue this light press and spread until the top of the Mysore Pak looks smooth.At this stage, using a knife, cut the Mysore Pak into rectangle or diamond shapes and allow the Mysore Pak to cool down completely.Once completely cooled, gently lift the Mysore Pak pieces out of the pan and serve.Store the Mysore Pak in airtight container for 1 week or in the refrigerator for 2 weeks.Serve Homemade Mysore Pak Recipe as a dessert after Onion Tomato Podi Masala Dosa Recipe and Chutney for breakfast or after lu"

But make sure that when you simmer the dal it is stirred occasionally, thereby preventing the dal makhani from sticking to the bottom of the pan.Finally, during the last 10 minutes of the simmering process, add the dried fenugreek leaves and the coriander leaves into the dal makhani.

Add a few drops of ghee and you will notice it begins to smoke. Cover the pan so the smoke circulated and flavours the dal.ýýAfter about 30 - 40 seconds, open the lid and remove the bowl.

","To begin making the Gujarati Kadhi Recipe, we will first combine all the yogurt, besan, ginger, green chilli and jaggery along with 2-1/2 cups of water together in a bowl and whisk until smooth and there are no lumps.Place the Gujarati kadhi mixture in a saucepan and heat until the kadhi begins to boil.Keep whisking the Kadhi as it continues to boil, as this makes it smooth and creamy, thus giving it a perfect texture.Once the kadhi has come together into a smooth and creamy mixture while it was boiling, turn the heat to low, and simmer to kadhi while we prepare the seasoning mixture. Keep simmering for 5 to 10 minutes.Simmer for at least 5 minutes before you can add the seasoning mixture. This ensures that the raw smells go away and we get creamy and delicious Gujarati Kadhi.Heat ghee in a sauce pan on medium heat; add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds and allow them to crackle. Stir in the curry leaves, cinnamon, green chillies and ginger.Gradually, add the seasoning mixture to the above Gujarati Kadhi and allow the mixture to come to a boil.Turn off heat and stir in the freshly chopped coriander leaves into the Kadhi and the optionally steamed green peas and serve hot.Serve the Gujarati Kadhi along withï¿½ï¿½Khichdiï¿½ï¿½andï¿½ï¿½Aloo Shaakï¿½ï¿½together known as Khichdi Kadhi andï¿½ï¿½Bat"

After 5 minutes have passed, turn off the heat and allow the pressure to release naturally. Rice cooks in this resting period, hence wait for the pressure to release completely.While we are waiting for the pressure to release, Lets proceed to make the seasoning.For seasoning the Bisi Bele Bath, heat a small pan on medium heat. Add in a tablespoon of ghee and allow it to melt. Add in the mustard seeds, the cumin seeds. Allow it to crackle. Then add in the red chilli, curry leaves and roast them until the red chillies are browned lightly. Stir to roast the ingredients well.

Ensure when you are grinding you add just enough water to bring them together. The batter should be thick, especially the rice and ragi batter.Combine the ragi batter and urad dal batter, add salt and then mix well. Cover and set in a warm place to ferment. About 8 to 10 hours or overnight.Read this detailed recipe of how to make theï¿½ï¿½Ragi Idli Dosa Batterï¿½ï¿½in different weather conditions.Once you have the fermentedï¿½ï¿½Ragi Idli batter, grease the Idli Steamer Platesï¿½ï¿½with a little sesame oil. This process is purely optional. I like to do this as it adds to the flavor of the idliï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s. Pour spoonfuls of the ragi idli batter into these moulds. Also making mini idli's mafier and easier to eat as well.Do make sure you fill the ragi idli batter only half way through as they will rise up to the top when steamed. Once all the plates are filled, place the filled idli racks one above the other making sure the holes are facing the filled portion.Prepare the idli steamer with a little water in the bottom. Place the filled ragi idli racks in the steamer. Place the steamer on high heat and steam the idliï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s for 10 minutes.After 10 minutes of steaming, turn off the heat. Open the steamer and insert a knife or a pick to test whether the idli's are cooked. If nothing sticks then the idlis are perfectly steamed.Now you can remove the ragi idli from the steamer. Have a small bowl filled with water. Dip a spoon in the water and then scoop the ragi idli out starting from the edges. Dipping the spoon in water helps in the easy removal of idli from the plates.The wholesome homemade soft ragi idli are now ready to be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner.Serve theï¿½ï¿½Ragi Idli Recipe aýCoconut Chutney,ýýRed Capsicum Chutney,ýýThakkali Vengaya SambarýýandýýIdli Milagai Podiýýfor a wholesomeýýindian diabetic breakfastýýor even for a light and healthyýýindian dinner."

This process will take about 15 to 20 minutes.The next step is the press the hot idlis in the sevai/ idiyappam maker or the sevai maker or a press, also called asï¿½ï¿½sevai nazhi.This is the most crucial stage. The idlis should be hot when you press to make the noodles. If it turns cold you will not be able to press the dumplings to get the noodles.Proceed to hot press one atime by turns the wheels of the sevai nazhi to get the uber soft noodles.Continue till you are done with all the sevai idli. Transfer the sevai to a large bowl as and when you finish. You sevai is now ready to be flavoured or eaten.The final step is to make the Lemon Sevai Recipe.Heat a kadai and add the oil. Add the mustard and allow it to crackle. Add the green chillies, ginger, peanuts, curry leaves and saute for a few seconds.Now add the turmeric powder and the steamed rice sevai/idiyappam and give the Lemon Sevai a quick stir. Now add the lemon juice and stir until combined well.Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste for the Lemon Sevai/ Idiyappam.Serve the Lemon Sevai for breakfast, a teatime snack or even for dinner along with Coconut Chutney or Mor Kuzhambu."

","To begin making Rose Flavoured Shahi Tukda Recipe, we will first make the rabri for this dish.*For the Basundi/Rabriï¿½ï¿½To begin making the Basundi Recipe, we will first have to condense the milk.

Once the sugar has dissolved and the milk is boiling vigorously for a few minutes reduce the heat to low and simmer the milk mixture stirring continuously until it is reduced to three fourths of its original quantity.The condensation will cause the cream from the milk to settle on the sides and bottom of the pan. Its important to keep scraping down the cream and adding it back to the condensing milk.The mixture will begin to thicken and get a creamy texture. It is important to make sure towards the end of the condensing process to be close to the stove monitoring the milk and stirring it continuously.The last stages are when the condensed milk can get burned at thetom of the pan and completely alter the taste of the basundi.Note Again: During the process of condensation of the milk, keep stirring the cream that keep forms, as it will stick to the sides and bottom of of them pan, while stirring keep scrapping down the sides and bottom to prevent burning of the cream.Once the milk has reduced to half of its original quantity, turn off the heat.

Traditional Bengali Rasgulla Recipe - Cottage Cheese Balls In Sweetened Syrup,,"Bengali rasgulla recipe is an excellent recipe for this regional classic from the state of West Bengal. Delicate cottage cheese dumplings, soaked in sugar syrup, theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re also called Rosogolla. The process has multiple steps, but yields a super soft rasgulla that is steamed and then soaked in a flavoured sugar ",Bengali Recipes,Dessert,Vegetarian,Total in 75 M,"

							 		6 cups Milk 

							 		3 tablespoons Lemon juice 

							 		2 tablespoons Curd (Dahi / Yogurt) 

							 		2 cups Sugar 

							 		4-1/2 cups Water 

							 		1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder (Elaichi) 

							 		1 Cloves (Laung) 
","To begin making the Bengali Rasgulla, first mix curd and lemon juice together in a bowl. Bring the milk to a roaring boil; when it starts to foam and rise, reduce the flame to medium and add curd-lemon juice mix and give it a stir. The milk will begin to curdle and get separated from the whey. When all the milk is curdled and only a clear whey remains, turn off the heat.The curdled milk is the cottage cheese, allow the milk to rest in the whey water for a few minutes. Spread a muslin cloth/cheese cloth (Make sure its big enough to get tied up) and drain the curdled milk.Now bring the edges of the cloth together and immerse it (up and down process) in a bowl filled with ice cubes and cold water. Slightly rub the bag so that it releases the lemon juice flavor and bring the curdled milk together to a ball. Squeeze water well and tie the bag.Now on a flat plate, first place the sack, then a tawa or plate and finally some heavy weight. This helps to squeeze all excess water. Let it sit for 1 hour without any disturbance, until you see a lot of whey is released.Remove the paneer from the muslin cloth and place it on a flat surface. Scramble and knead using your palm for 10 minutes. You can feel the paneer getting soft. Make them to equal-sized balls by rolling in your hand, making sure there are no cracks on the ball surface.In a pressure cooker (wide enough) boil sugar and water. When bubbles starts to form, add Cardamom powder, clove and paneer balls (one by one) slowly. Cover the cooker and pressure cook for 1 whistle.After a whistle, reduce the flame to low and let it simmer for another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure come down.Once the pressure is completely released, open the cooker. You will notice the Rosogolla are doubled in their size. Replace the rasgullas carefully to another bowl, cool down completely. Refrigerate for 2 hours minimum before serving.NotesWash the paneer well to avoid lemon taste in rasgullas.Squeeze the maximum to drain the water and then place a weight.You can use the whey water for making chapati batter.Kneading the dough is a very important step to get the rasgullas soft.My friend's mother suggested to add a teaspoon of maida and stir after kneading the paneer. This helps rasgullas to be a bit firm and withstands its round shape.If you feel the paneer is very much drained or is not binding while making balls, then drizzle some drops of water alone and knead again.Please make sure to use a wide cooker or pan as rasgulla expand after cooking.Do replace rasgullas to another bowl after cooking to avoid overheating.We can also prepare them in a large pan by simply closing them for 10 to 15 minutes after paneer balls are added.When rasgullas are cooked they are extremely soft but will get firm after refrigerating."

Cover the cooker, place the weight on and pressure cook until you hear two whistles. After two whistles, turn off the heat. We will allow the pressure to release naturally.Until then, we will proceed to make the masala for the Theeyal.In a small pan, dry roast the fenugreek seeds, coriander seeds and red chillies in a shallow fry pan until you can smell the aromas coming through. Next add the coconut and roast for about 2 to 3 minutes, until the coconut turn lightly golden.Once the coconut is roasted, add all the ingredients into the food grinder, add a little warm water and blend to make a smooth paste. This is the Theeyal Masala.By this time, the pressure in the cooker would have released. Open the cooker and add the theeyal masala to the cooked bitte(pavakkai). Stir well.With the ingredients still in the cooker, turn the heat on and give the Pavakka Theeyal a quick boil. Add a little water to adjust the consistency of the theeyal. Theeyal is usually a thick curry like sambar, so if you wish it to be a little thinner then add water. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.After it reached a boil, turn off the heat.The last step is to make the seasoning for the Pavakka Theeyal.Heat oil in a tadka pan, add the mustard seeds, red chillies and curry leaves, allow it to roast and crackle.

","To begin making theï¿½ï¿½Stuffed Gobi Ka Paratha, we will get all the ingredients ready and handy by the side. The important step is to make a crumble of the cauliflower. You can either chop the cauliflower with a knife or grate using a grater. But in the method below I will be using a Chopper/ Food Processor.We will first knead the dough for the paratha. In a large mixing bowl, add the flour and salt. Add water little at a time and knead to make a soft and smooth dough. Once all the flour has come together, drizzle a teaspoon of oil on the top of the dough and knead for another couple of minutes. Cover the dough and we will proceed to make the stuffing for the Gobi Paratha.ï¿½ï¿½To make the stuffing for the Gobi Paratha, add all the ingredients for the stuffing - Cauliflower florets, chopped onions, green chillies, ginger, coriander leaves, flax seeds, cumin powder and salt into a Food Processor. Pulse to make a coarse mixture of the gobi stuffing mixture.Transfer the stuffing to a bowl and check the salt an and adjust to suit your taste.The next step is to cook the Gobi Paratha. There are multiple ways to stuff parathas, but in this recipe, I am going to show you a really simple and fun way to do the stuffed paratha.Divide the dough portions into medium lemon size balls. Place some flour aside for dusting.Pat the portion of the dough and dust it in flour. Roll out the dough into a 5 inch diameter circle. Spoon a large portion of the filling and place it on one-half of the circle.Spread the gobi filling evenly on one-half of the circle and then cover it with the other half to form a half-moon shaped paratha or bring the edges together to the center to make a circular shape. Seal the edges by pinching and pressing it.Dust the paratha lightly in flour again and roll gently to remove any air pockets.ï¿½ï¿½Roll the paratha, adding very little pressure so the filling stays inside and does not ooze out.Proceed the same way to fill the remaining Gobi Paratha.The next step is to cook the paratha on the skillet or roti týýPreheat the skillet and then place the rolled out paratha on the skillet.Flip and cook on both sides until you see small air pockets coming out. Drizzle ghee or oil on the paratha and cook on low to medium heat until the paratha is cooked through and golden brown on both sides.Once cooked, transfer the paratha to a platter and cook the remaining Gobi Parathas the similar way.Serve the Gobi Paratha with a spicy mango pickle andýýCurd for a lovely breakfast."

							 		1/2 cup Chana dal (Bengal Gram Dal) 

							 		1 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera) 

							 		1 teaspoon Red Chilli powder 

							 		1 teaspoon Coriander Powder (Dhania)

							 		1 tablespoon Coriander (Dhania) Leaves							 		, chopped finely (optional)							 	

Salt							 		, to taste							 	

Oil							 		, to deep fry							 	
","To begin making Bihari Chana Dal Puri Recipe, pressure cook chana dal with enough water for about 2 whistles or until cooked enough to get easily mashed. Also do not overcook the dal since it will make the puri mushy. Once chana dal is cool, drain all the water and mash it. It is up to you to mash it completely or leave it grainy.Heat oil in a wide bottomed pan. Add cumin seeds and let it splutter. Then add mashed chana dal and the spice powders and salt. Mix well. Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes. You can add a little coriander leaves too at this stage. Remove the dal from the pan and transfer it to a bowl to cool.Once it cools down, make lemon sized balls and keep aside.Knead whole wheat flour with little salt and water into stiff but soft dough. Cover to let it sit for about 30 minutes.Heat oil in a wide pan for deep frying.Divide the dough into equal sized balls. Flatten one of the ball into 3 to 4 inch diameter circle. Place a ball of spicy chana dal stuffing in the middle. Carefully bring all the edges of the dough to seal the stuffing well.Flatten this into small circles making sure the stuffing does not fall apart. Carefully transfer the flattened puri into hot oil. Flip to let the puri puff on both sides. These stuffed puris will not give a huge puff like unstuffed plain ones, though. Once puris appear brownish and done, transfer them on paper towels to drain excess oil. Repeat the step for all the remaining dough to get puris.Serve this Bihari Chana Dal Puri Recipe hot with any side dish of your choice, like Soya Kheema, Kaale chane ki ghugni, Mooga Gathi or Methi Paneer Bhurji in cream gravy.
